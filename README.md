# lsdj-flasher-tools
Tools for backing up and flashing insideGadgets Game Boy cartridges (works for 4mb SRAM and 4mb FRAM carts including LinkNLoad32. May work with 2mb carts but not tested).

To use backup-rom and backup-save, simply run or double click and the ROM or SAV will be backed up to a file with a timestamp.

To use flash-cart, first double click and choose the type of cart you are going to flash. Once this is complete, you'll be able to drag a ROM or SAV onto the .exe and it should flash the cartridge. If it hangs, press Ctrl+C to exit, and then disconnect the flasher from USB. Then reconnect the flasher and try again.
